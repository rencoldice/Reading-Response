<a id="r1" href="#p1">>What is Code?_Paul Ford, What Screens Want_ Frank Chimero</a><br>
    <p>-In “What Screens Want”, Frank Chimero gives us some metaphors of software, while I’m thinking about the best metaphor might be the language itself. While we learning a foreign language, we start from the alphabet, from easy to hard, the vocabularies, sentences, grammar, morphological, we take in the essential, and then we can apply, create, and imagine.
        <br>-Actually, if you consider the computer as a nation, it sounds like a wonderland. We benefit from it everyday blending ourselves with its productions. That seems natural enough but we ignored that we are simply viewing the paintings of coders and reading the sonnets of programmers.
        <br>-I’m impressed by this paragraph by Paul Ford in”What is Code”: “I learn about the world through software. I learned about publishing by using the desktop publishing system QuarkXPress, and I learned about color and art by using a program called Deluxe Paint. Software taught me math and basic statistics. It taught me how to calculate great circle distance, estimating the distance between two points on a globe. I learned about the Internet by creating Web pages, and I learned about music through MIDI. And most of all, software taught me about software.”
        <br>-Before I’m considering what do we learn by learning codes after all? I guess it’s the rabbit hole to another wonderland, to see and to understand another way of ingenious beauty. I guess that’s also why some parents send their children to learn Scratch, let them know how much you can do applying a language to the corresponding context.
        <br>-The computer is not the almighty, but creation is the miracle. It’s not only about the fancy world the codes constituted, but more importantly, it’s about the original raw past and the imaginative future.</p>

    <p>I enjoy the way Olia Lialina led readers to look back. We often see things coming back to the previous styles, not only clothes, websites, also in some other appearance relevant design subjects. Undeniably, some elements are really charming and bring the nostalgic sensations. I feel perhaps retro is the natural instinct of design. Now the net art has changed a lot, though there are clear clues for designers to follow to please the potential audiences, I’m still reluctant to say the word “trend”, in my mind the word is something under consumerism. Instead, I prefer to understand what might be the driving power under the change, the digital aesthetic, and the ever-changing design philosophy and judgments.
        In Jodi’s Infrastructure, Galloway gave us a way to consider the relationship between art and media. We can say the media itself is art when we think about the question between content and form, or between function and tech, maybe we can start from the very basic way, the philosophy, principle, and logic.</p>
    <a id="r3" href="#p3">Capitalism vs. Privacy_Samuel Earle, Critical Atlas of Internet_Louise Drulhe</a><br>
    <p>Information capitalism is not a piece of news, but it is getting stronger and stronger because its basic driving force is still the satisfaction of individual desires and the endless competition guided by the pursuit of profits. I feel the Internet now in some ways are not interacting with us as its original way. I use another search engine a lot, Google is not available in China, but just aware that gradually I cannot directly find what I really want from that search engine. They are utilizing private data to deliver personalized accurate advertising, these information comes from my social media, my online shopping record, movie tickets I bought, and even from the number of how many steps I walk every day. That’s a terrible truth that more than grasping our privacy, they even start to impinge on our freedom of choice. But how can we fight against this? Maybe hope there are rules on information to safeguard the cyberspace security.
        Technology itself has no right or wrong, good or bad, it is neutral. But the intention can be good or evil.  While we chose to believe the scientific and technological means benefit for us, the truth is that, in one sense, netizens are all in the cyber streaking carnival.
        By the way, I really love the way the author interpreted concepts with these information maps in Critical Atlas of the Internet.</p>
    <a id="r4" href="#p4">New Clues</a><br>
<p>Knowledge is infinite. Once we swam around the shore, looked at the faraway thin line of horizon, you knew better what means arrive in a distance. With the Internet, we are like boating at the center of the ocean. It’s faster, you have more tools to fall back on, you even have a chance to take on a massive ship and reach a lot of destinations. However, the destination of the sea is another sea, you are always in the middle of it, facing so many directions, you are lost. Where is the true destination? Your unquenchable urge is dying out.
    This is a chaos and information-overload age, where some ‘knowledge’ is vainglorious and facile, producing powerful but low-end tumults. The books once you cannot finish in your whole life now becomes the “content” that you cannot finish in tenfold lifetime. Of course you don’t have to read it at all, these paddings filled the time cranny, will then being punctured easily and cause a sense of importance and helpless, which already became the anxiety that hard to treat.
    Everyone is running into the Internet, cheering or shouting. In spite of the exhausting temperature , there are uninterrupted bonuses. With a momentary victory, you became an empire that can overwhelm countless newcomers and pioneers. But time will tell what is good, beautiful and true. Distance produces beauty, whether the Internet break the limitation of time and space, or distant something else?</p>
